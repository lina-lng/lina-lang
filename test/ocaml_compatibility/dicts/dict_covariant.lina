(* Test: Dict is covariant - relaxed value restriction *)
(* Expected: ACCEPT - Dict applied to id should be usable polymorphically *)

let id x = x
let empty = id (Dict.empty ())

(* The dict type is covariant, so this should work *)
let d1 = Dict.set "a" 1 empty
let d2 = Dict.set true "yes" empty

let _ = print (Dict.size d1)
let _ = print (Dict.size d2)
