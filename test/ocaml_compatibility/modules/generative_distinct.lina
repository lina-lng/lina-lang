(* Generative functor creates distinct types per application *)

module F () = struct
  type t = int
  let create n = n
end

module A = F ()
module B = F ()

(* A.t and B.t are distinct even though both are int internally *)
let a : A.t = A.create 1
let b : B.t = B.create 2

(* This should work - each module uses its own type *)
let _ = print (a + 0)
let _ = print (b + 0)
