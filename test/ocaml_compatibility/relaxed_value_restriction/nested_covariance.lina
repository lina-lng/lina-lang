(* Relaxed value restriction: nested covariant types generalized *)
(* Expected: ACCEPT - option of list is covariant, generalized *)

type 'a list = Nil | Cons of ('a * 'a list)
type 'a option = None | Some of 'a

let id x = x

(* id (Some Nil) is NOT a value *)
(* But 'a option and 'a list are both covariant *)
(* So 'a in 'a list option is covariant and can be generalized *)
let maybe_empty = id (Some Nil)

(* Should be polymorphic *)
let opt1 : int list option = maybe_empty
let opt2 : bool list option = maybe_empty

let _ = print 0
