(* Variance: ref is invariant in its type parameter *)
(* Expected: REJECT - ref is invariant, cannot generalize *)

type 'a list = Nil | Cons of ('a * 'a list)

let id x = x

(* ref (id Nil) is NOT a value *)
(* ref is invariant, so relaxed VR doesn't help *)
let r = ref (id Nil)

(* Should fail - r is monomorphic after first use *)
let _ = (r : int list ref)
let _ = (r : bool list ref)
