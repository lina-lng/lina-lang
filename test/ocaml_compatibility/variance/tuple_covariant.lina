(* Variance: tuple is covariant in all parameters *)
(* Expected: ACCEPT - ('a * 'b) is covariant in both 'a and 'b *)

type 'a list = Nil | Cons of ('a * 'a list)

let id x = x

(* id (Nil, Nil) is NOT a value *)
(* Tuple is covariant in both positions *)
(* So relaxed VR allows generalization *)
let pair = id (Nil, Nil)

(* Should be polymorphic in both components *)
let _ = (pair : (int list * bool list))
let _ = (pair : (string list * float list))

let _ = print 0
